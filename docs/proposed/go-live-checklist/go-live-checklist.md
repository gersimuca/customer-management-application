# Go Live Checklist - ERP Digital Contract

## Overview
This is a working document to be checked for completeness.

**Note:**
- Take external dependencies into considerations
- Add general risk register, business requirements, technical and administrative tasks

## Priorities

**LOW** → due diligence for go-live, but does not block it
**MEDIUM** → important for go-live, can potentially interfere or cause problems
**CRITICAL** → absolutely critical for go-live, complete blocker if not done

## Technical Tasks

*This checklist is based on Warranty Checklist and CDMS checklist. Other checklists as inspiration: EDCC, EMMP, CoCa, Data2Credits*
